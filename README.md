# Movie App

This project is from the Day 17 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.

### Overall Impression

Good refresher on using APIs for getting data. I really like the overview pop-up effect and may look for ways to implement something similar in other apps.

** To keep my API key hidden I am not deploying this app.

### Things Learned

* There is a main tag in HTML
* Target placeholder style with ::placeholder pseudo selector
* Have mostly only used destructuring in React and have not seen it applied to fetching API data
