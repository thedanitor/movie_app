# Movie App

https://thedanitor.github.io/movie_app/

This project is from the Day 17 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.
